          <h2>Pesto Pasta</h2>
          <p>
            Very quick Pesto Pasta, very simple to make. A great choice for
            family meals
          </p>
          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1 large handful fresh spinach</li>
            <li>
              8–12 cloves garlic (depending on your preference/size of meal)
            </li>
            <li>4 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>100–200 g feta cheese</li>
            <li>200 g pitted kalamata olives</li>
            <li>1 small package of snap peas</li>
            <li>1–2 chicken breasts (can substitute salmon or steak)</li>
            <li>About 500 g linguine</li>
            <li>Pesto</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Preperation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Lightly sauté the garlic in a pan—this is not meant to completely
              cook it, but to take a little of the bite off of it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chop the garlic up a bit in a food processor, then add the spinach
              bit by bit (stems may be left on if you like). When you have
              completed mixing the garlic and spinach together, add the olive
              oil and mix. Put into a bowl and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              Strip the snap peas of the stringy bits and the hard ends, and
              place those aside in a bowl as well.
            </li>

            <li>
              Start the water on the stove at a medium temperature to prevent
              the water from boiling, but able to easily obtain a boil at your
              whim. Start the grill and put the chicken (or other meat) on at a
              medium temperature. When it has heated up, put a bit of olive oil
              on each side to prevent sticking. When the meat is about a quarter
              done, you want to have the water boiling. Put the linguine in, and
              if you wish, add a bit of olive oil for flavor.
            </li>

            <li>
              While you are doing this, put the snap peas in a small frying pan
              with some olive oil at a low-medium temperature to warm them up a
              bit.
            </li>

            <li>
              When the pasta and meat are cooked (try and get these finished
              cooking at the same time), slice the chicken into strips (in the
              case of the steak/salmon, it may be better to just leave it in
              fillet/steak form for presentation purposes). Strain the pasta,
              and put it in a frying pan along with some of the pesto (by
              portion) to heat the pesto up a bit. Make sure it is not at a high
              temperature, as that will cause the pasta to crisp up. When you
              have finished this, put it on a plate and top with feta and
              olives.
            </li>

            <li>
              Arrange the snap peas and meat strips on top as well, and there's
              your dinner!
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Sunday Roast</h2>
          <p>
            Roast dinners are traditionally served on Sunday, but can also be
            eaten throughout the week. The precise recipe of a roast dinner will
            vary considerably from person to person, so below is a broad
            overview of common elements that can be adapted and made your own.
          </p>
          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              1 joint (about 3 pounds / 1.5 kg) of good quality beef rib or
              rolled rib beef
            </li>
            <li>Extra beef bones (optional)</li>
            <li>½ cup sifted all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon (5 ml) salt (rock salt preferred)</li>
            <li>
              1 pinch of ground black pepper (as much as can be held between the
              finger/thumb)
            </li>
            <li>¼ cup olive oil or other good cooking oil</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1 glass of full-bodied red wine</li>
            <li>
              1 teaspoon (45 ml) red jam (mix with a little water and strain out
              the seeds if using raspberry or blackberry)
            </li>
            <li>1 pinch of nutmeg</li>
            <li>
              1 teaspoon (5 ml) Lea and Perrin's Worcestershire sauce and/or
              Maggi stock cube
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Preperation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Combine some plain flour, a little rock-salt and a good pinch of
              ground pepper.
            </li>

            <li>
              In a large frying pan, heat some olive oil, then sear (i.e.
              briefly fry) the fatty edges of the meat until they are a dark
              brown colour.
            </li>

            <li>Remove joint and bones from the frying pan. Lower the heat</li>

            <li>
              Using the spare beef bones, make a 'bed' for the joint on the
              bottom of the hot roasting tin, adding a coarsely chopped onion to
              the bed. The idea is to keep the joint a little raised from the
              bottom of the tin. Add a cupful of water and pour the contents of
              the deglazed frying pan, including the onion, over the joint.
            </li>

            <li>
              Place the joint on its bed, or on the rack Leave the meat to cook,
              without opening the oven for about 15 minutes at 200°C (400°F).
            </li>

            <li>
              Reduce the oven temperature to about 180°C (350°F). You no longer
              need to baste the joint now.
            </li>

            <li>
              Once the cooking has completed, take the joint out of the roasting
              tin and place it on its own separate dish.
            </li>

            <li>
              Carve thin slices of the meat. Serve with the roast potatoes, as
              well as 3 or more side vegetables such as roast parsnips, green
              beans, and cabbage with a little bacon.
            </li>
          </ul>
